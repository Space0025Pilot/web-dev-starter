## Overview

Added to a template website to create a website in which my classmates can get to know me! For this project, I needed to add CSS rules to make it fancy, unordered list about myself, and add a button and alert! Overall, it went well and I didn't exactly know how to create and implement the button and alert, but I do now and from this I learned a lot. Very informative and enhancing my skills.

Note in the Live Preview the button and alert aren't supported. Open it in the browser and both functions work just fine.

## Sources and Credits

I utilized googling some aspects such as resizing my picture, centering text and images, and then for the button and alert.

- Resize Image: https://imagekit.io/blog/how-to-resize-image-in-html/
- Center Align Text: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.ASP
- Center Image: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp
- How to Connect Button/Alert Box: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39665019/calling-an-alert-function-from-a-button-but-without-using-onclick

Note on this last one, I really wasn't sure how to do this and didn't remember how to so I found this outside help and did something similar to what they did. I was also able to make the function work with the button, but also keep the 'hello' displaying to the console. So the QUnit tests would still pass. I did have to recreate the QUnit test to account for the changes I made to Java Script.

- Interesting Resource I found on Listeners: https://www.shecodes.io/athena/41313-how-to-apply-a-function-to-a-specific-button-in-javascript#:~:text=Assuming%20you%20want%20to%20apply,when%20the%20button%20is%20clicked
